# heartbeat and temperature monitoring
This project focuses on the development of a Heartbeat and Temperature Monitoring system for accurate patient vital sign tracking. The system employs the versatile Arduino Uno microcontroller, known for its adaptability in various embedded applications. It integrates two key components:

Temperature Monitoring: The LM35 temperature sensor ensures precise and reliable temperature measurements. It connects to the Arduino Uno’s analog pin A0, enabling accurate temperature data processing.
Heartbeat Monitoring: A dedicated heartbeat sensor is linked to digital pin 7 of the Arduino Uno, facilitating the measurement and processing of the patient’s heart rate.
The system’s vital sign data is presented in real-time on an LCD display, enhancing its user-friendliness. This integrated setup guarantees accurate data collection and presentation, empowering healthcare professionals to monitor patients’ vital signs with precision and ease.
